= Vhost/subdomain lighty

These config files constitute a small, portable solution to hosting lighty sites on an
ad-hoc basis, without intefering with a cpanel/plesk hosting setup.  Once set up, you
need never touch it again.  You just add sites by adding lighttpd.conf and vhost.conf
files in the vhost (or subdomain) directories.

= How it works

In lighttpd.conf, hosts.conf.rb is called.  This script searches for any lighttpd.conf
files in any vhost subdirectories, and if found creates a host conditional for them.

hosts.conf.db is easy to configure, and you should be able to use it for just about any
directory/subdomain setup.  By default the script is setup to work with a Plesk 8 dir-
ectory layout.  That is:

  /var/www/vhosts/:vhost:
  /var/www/vhosts/:vhost:/subdomains/:subdomain: 

but it should be a matter of minutes to configure the script to work with other layouts,
even with two subdomains.

= A small problem

I encountered a small problem with lighttpd 1.4.11.  It complained when I tried to use
the 'include_shell' directive (kinda essential).  It said that SHELL was not set.
This is no problem if you're manually starting lighty, you can export it (if it's not
already), but I'm using the init.d script.  So I simply had to add

  export SHELL=/bin/sh

near the top of /etc/init.d/lighttpd

= Other things

Also included is:
 - a rails.conf include script which can be configured by setting three vars 
   before including it (see the script for details).
 - an example vhost.conf and lighttpd.conf file, which would be placed in the
   conf directory of your vhost or subdomain
